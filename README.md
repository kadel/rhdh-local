# Test Locally With Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH)

Welcome to RHDH Local - the fastest and simplest way for platform engineers to test their software catalogs, techdocs, plugins, templates, homepage customizations, configurations and more with RHDH!

RHDH Local is ideal for trying out the basic features of RHDH (like Software Catalogs or TechDocs) without the need for a Kubernetes cluster. RHDH Local is also great for testing dynamic plugins and their configuration settings. To use RHDH Local, all you really need is basic knowledge of Docker or Podman, a PC, and a web browser. You can run it on your laptop, desktop, or on your homelab. Better still, when you're done working it's easy to remove.

>**RHDH Local is NOT a substitute for Red Hat Developer Hub**. Do not attempt to use RHDH Local as a production system. RHDH Local is designed to help individual developers test various RHDH features. It's not designed to scale and it's not suitable for use by teams (there is no RBAC for example). There's also (currently) no official support for RHDH Local. You use RHDH Local at your own risk. With all that being said, we think it's incredibly useful and any contributions you might have that could improve RHDH Local are welcome!

## What You'll Need Before You Get Started

To use RHDH Local you'll need a few things:

1. A PC based on an x86 64Bit (amd64) architecture (ARM is on the way)
1. An installation of Docker or Podman (with adequate resources available)
1. An internet connection (for downloading container images, plugins, etc.)
1. (Optional) The `git` command line client for cloning this repository (or you can download and extract the Zip from GitHub)
1. (Optional) A GitHub account (if you want to integrate GitHub features into RHDH)
1. (Optional) The node `npx` tool (if you intend to use GitHub authentication in RHDH)
1. (Optional) A [Red Hat account](https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#getting-a-red-hat-login-2) (if you want to use a PostgreSQL database)

### Note for Mac M1 users

If you're using an Apple Silicon (M1/M2) Mac, the default RHDH image (`quay.io/rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9:1.4`) is not compatible with the ARM64 architecture.
To fix this, you can add this line to your `.env` file (create the file if it doesn't exist):

`RHDH_IMAGE=quay.io/rhdh-community/rhdh:next`

This image supports both `amd64` and `arm64`.
## Getting Started With RHDH Local

1. Clone this repository to a location on your PC

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-local.git
   ```

1. Move to the `rhdh-local` folder.

   ```sh
   cd rhdh-local
   ```

1. (Optional) You can create a local `.env` file and override any of the default variables defined in the [`default.env`](./default.env) file provided. You can also add additional variables.
   In most cases, when you don't need GitHub Auth or testing different releases, you can skip this step, and it should work.

1. (Optional) Create local configuration overrides.

   RHDH Local supports user-specific configuration overrides using a structured `configs/` directory. You do not need to modify default files. However, if you want to customize your setup:

   - Add your app config overrides to: `configs/app-config/app-config.local.yaml`
      > You can use the included `.example.yaml` files to get started quickly:
      >
      > ```sh
      > cp configs/app-config/app-config.local.example.yaml configs/app-config/app-config.local.yaml
      > cp configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.example.yaml configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml
      > ```

   - Add your plugin config overrides to:  
     `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml`
     > The override file must start with:
     > ```yaml
     > includes:
     >   - dynamic-plugins.default.yaml
     > ```
     > This ensures the base plugin list is preserved and extended, rather than replaced.

   - Add any extra files (like GitHub credentials) to: `configs/extra-files/`

   If present, these files will be automatically loaded by the system on startup.

   If you need features that fetch files from GitHub you should configure `integrations.github`.
   The recommended way is to use GitHub Apps. You can find hints on how to configure it in [github-app-credentials.example.yaml](configs/github-app-credentials.example.yaml) or a more detailed instruction in [Backstage documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/integrations/github/github-apps).

2. Start RHDH Local.
   This repository should work with either `docker compose` using Docker Engine or `podman-compose` using Podman. When using Podman there are some exceptions. Check [Known Issues when using Podman Compose](#known-issues-when-using-podman-compose) for more info.

   ```sh
   podman-compose up -d
   ```

   If you prefer `docker compose` you can just replace `podman-compose` with `docker compose`

   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```

## Changing Your Configuration

When you change `app-config.local.yaml` you must restart the `rhdh` container to load RHDH your updated configuration.

```sh
podman-compose stop rhdh && podman-compose start rhdh
```

When you change `dynamic-plugins.yaml` you need to re-run the `install-dynamic-plugins` container and then restart RHDH instance.

```sh
podman-compose run install-dynamic-plugins
podman-compose stop rhdh && podman-compose start rhdh
```

## Loading dynamic plugins from a local directory

During boot, the `install-dynamic-plugins` container reads the contents of the plugin configuration file and activates, configures, or downloads any plugins listed. RHDH Local supports two ways of specifying dynamic plugin configuration:

1. Default path: `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.yaml`

1. User override path: `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml` or `configs/dynamic-plugins.yaml` If present, this file will automatically override the default and be used by the `install-dynamic-plugins` container. `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml` takes precedence over `configs/dynamic-plugins.yaml`.

In addition, the `local-plugins` directory is mounted into the `install-dynamic-plugins` container at `/opt/app-root/src/local-plugins`. Any plugins placed there can be activated/configured the same way (without downloading).

To load dynamic plugins from your local machine:

1. Copy the dynamic plugin binary file into the `local-plugins` directory.
2. Make sure permissions allow the container to read the files (e.g. `chmod -R 777 local-plugins` for quick testing).
3. Configure your plugin in one of the supported config files:
    - Prefer `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml` for local user overrides.
    - If no override file is present, `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.yaml` will be used.
4. See [Changing Your Configuration](#changing-your-configuration) for more on updating and reloading configs.

## Optional: Customize `.npmrc` for Plugin Installation

If you're installing dynamic plugins from a private registry or using a proxy, you can customize your own `.npmrc` file. A `.npmrc.example` file is provided in the `configs/` directory as a template.

1. Copy the example file to create your own `.npmrc`:

    ```sh
    cp configs/.npmrc.example configs/.npmrc
    ```

2. Open the newly created `.npmrc` file and add your configuration, such as private registry URLs or authentication tokens:

    ```sh
    //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN
    registry=https://your-private-registry.example.com/
    ```

When present, this `.npmrc` file will be automatically mounted into the `install-dynamic-plugins` container, and the `NPM_CONFIG_USERCONFIG` environment variable will be set to point to it.

If you don't create a `.npmrc`, plugin installation will still work using the default public registry settings.

> For more information on configuring `.npmrc`, see the [npm configuration docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/npmrc).

## Changing The Container Image

You can switch between RHDH and Janus-IDP by changing the container image name hold by the `RHDH_IMAGE` environment variable in your `.env` file.

To use nightly build of Janus-IDP, set the variable as follows:

```sh
RHDH_IMAGE=quay.io/janus-idp/backstage-showcase:next
```

To use the official release of RHDH 1.4, set the variable as follows:

```sh
RHDH_IMAGE=quay.io/rhdh/rhdh-hub-rhel9:1.4
```

## Testing RHDH in a simulated corporate proxy setup

If you want to test how RHDH would behave if deployed in a corporate proxy environment,
you can run `podman-compose` or `docker-compose` by merging both the [`compose.yaml`](./compose.yaml) and [`compose-with-corporate-proxy.yaml`](./compose-with-corporate-proxy.yaml) files.

Example with `podman-compose` (note that the order of the YAML files is important):

```sh
podman-compose \
   -f compose.yaml \
   -f compose-with-corporate-proxy.yaml \
   up -d
```

The [`compose-with-corporate-proxy.yaml`](compose-with-corporate-proxy.yaml) file includes a specific [Squid](https://www.squid-cache.org/)-based proxy container as well as an isolated network, such that:

1. only the proxy container has access to the outside
2. all containers part of the internal network need to communicate through the proxy container to reach the outside. This can be done with the `HTTP(S)_PROXY` and `NO_PROXY` environment variables.

## Cleanup

To reset RHDH Local you can use the following command. This will clean up any container attached volumes, but configuration changes made to your `rhdh-local` YAML files will remain.

```sh
podman-compose down --volumes
```

To reset everything in the cloned `rhdh-local` repository, including any configuration changes you've made to your YAML files try:

```sh
git reset --hard
```

To remove the RHDH containers completely from your system (after you have run a `compose down`):

```sh
docker system prune --volumes # For rhdh-local running on docker
podman system prune --volumes # For rhdh-local running on podman
```

### Known Issues when using Podman Compose

Works with `podman-compose` only with image that include this following fix https://github.com/janus-idp/backstage-showcase/pull/1585

Older images don't work in combination with `podman-compose`.
This is due to https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHIDP-3939. RHDH images currently populate dynamic-plugins-root directory with all plugins that are packaged inside the image.
Before podman mounts volume over `dynamic-plugins-root` directory it copies all existing files into the volume. When the plugins are installed using `install-dynamic-plugins.sh` script it create duplicate installations of some plugins, this situation than prevents Backstage to start.

This also doesn't work with `podman compose` when using `docker-compose` as external compose provider on macOS.

It fails with

```
install-dynamic-plugins-1  | Traceback (most recent call last):
install-dynamic-plugins-1  |   File "/opt/app-root/src/install-dynamic-plugins.py", line 429, in <module>
install-dynamic-plugins-1  |     main()
install-dynamic-plugins-1  |   File "/opt/app-root/src/install-dynamic-plugins.py", line 206, in main
install-dynamic-plugins-1  |     with open(dynamicPluginsFile, 'r') as file:
install-dynamic-plugins-1  | PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'dynamic-plugins.yaml'
```

It looks like `docker-compose` when used with podman doesn't correctly propagate `Z` SElinux label.

## Using PostgreSQL database

By default, in-memory db is used.
If you want to use PostgreSQL with RHDH, here are the steps:

> **NOTE**: You must have [Red Hat Login](https://access.redhat.com/RegistryAuthentication#getting-a-red-hat-login-2) to use `postgresql` image.

1. Login to container registry with *Red Hat Login* credentials to use `postgresql` image

   ```sh
   podman login registry.redhat.io
   ```

   If you prefer `docker` you can just replace `podman` with `docker`

   ```sh
   docker login registry.redhat.io
   ```

2. Uncomment the `db` service block in [compose.yaml](compose.yaml) file

   ```yaml
   db:
     image: "registry.redhat.io/rhel8/postgresql-16:latest"
     volumes:
       - "/var/lib/pgsql/data"
     env_file:
       - path: "./default.env"
         required: true
       - path: "./.env"
         required: false
     environment:
       - POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
     healthcheck:
       test: ["CMD", "pg_isready", "-U", "postgres"]
       interval: 5s
       timeout: 5s
       retries: 5
   ```

3. Uncomment the `db` section in the `depends_on` section of `rhdh` service in [compose.yaml](compose.yaml)

   ```yaml
   depends_on:
     install-dynamic-plugins:
       condition: service_completed_successfully
     db:
       condition: service_healthy
   ```

4. Comment out the SQLite in-memory configuration in [`app-config.local.yaml`](configs/app-config.local.yaml)

   ```yaml
   # database:
   #   client: better-sqlite3
   #   connection: ':memory:'
   ```

## For plugin Developers
- [Using VSCode to debug backend plugins](docs/plugin-development/debugging.md)
- [Frontend Plugin Development](docs/plugin-development/frontend-development.md)

## Configuring Registry Credentials

Place your registry credentials in `./configs/extra-files`, then reference the auth file in your `.env`:

```bash
REGISTRY_AUTH_FILE=/opt/app-root/src/configs/extra-files/auth.json
```

This allows RHDH-local to pull OCI artifacts from registries like registry.redhat.io without authentication errors.
