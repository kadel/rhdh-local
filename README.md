# RHDH Local

The fastest and simplest way for platform engineers to test Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH) features locally.

RHDH Local lets you quickly test software catalogs, TechDocs, plugins, templates, and configurations without needing a cluster. Perfect for individual development and testing on your laptop, desktop, or homelab.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> - RHDH Local is **NOT a substitute for Red Hat Developer Hub**.
> - It is for development and testing only, **not for production use**.
> - It is designed for individual developers try out various RHDH features, not for teams as there is no out-of-the-box RBAC support.
> - There is no official, commercial support for RHDH Local. Use RHDH Local at your own risk.

## Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**: [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation) v5.4.1+ (recommended) or [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) v28.1.0+ with Compose support

2. **Clone and start**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-local.git && cd rhdh-local
   podman compose up -d  # or: docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access**: Open [http://localhost:7007](http://localhost:7007) and log in as 'Guest'

## Built-in Documentation

RHDH Local includes comprehensive technical TechDocs covering everything you need to know about it. Once running, access the documentation directly in the application for detailed guides on:

- **Getting Started**: Understanding RHDH Local's purpose and capabilities
- **Loading Content**: Adding catalogs, templates, and TechDocs
- **Dynamic Plugins**: Installing, configuring, and developing plugins
- **GitHub Integration**: Setting up authentication and content fetching
- **Local Development**: Working with plugins and configurations
- **Operations**: Running, restarting, and troubleshooting

The built-in documentation provides step-by-step technical instructions with examples.

## Quick Commands

> **Note**: Replace `podman` with `docker` if using Docker.

### After Plugin changes

After modifying the plugins configuration, for example after configuring plugins using the Extensions in the RHDH UI:

```sh
# Reinstall plugins and restart RHDH
podman compose run install-dynamic-plugins  # or: docker compose run install-dynamic-plugins
podman compose restart rhdh                  # or: docker compose restart rhdh
```

### Quick restart (No Plugin changes)

For configuration-only changes:

```sh
# Just restart RHDH (if plugins haven't changed)
podman compose restart rhdh  # or: docker compose restart rhdh
```

### Clean up

```sh
podman compose down --volumes  # or: docker compose down --volumes
```

## Breaking changes and known issues

### Upgrading to RHDH 1.9

More details in the [RHDH 1.9 Release Notes](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.9/html/red_hat_developer_hub_release_notes/index).

If you switch your `RHDH_IMAGE` to 1.9+ (default value in this branch), you may need to:

1. **Update your `dynamic-plugins.override.yaml`**

Some plugins are no longer bundled in the RHDH image, but have been moved to OCI references.

See [Migration Steps](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.9/html/dynamic_plugins_reference/ref-community-plugins-migration_title-plugins-rhdh-about#migration-steps) for more information.

Also see [configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.example.yaml](configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.example.yaml) for an example.

2. **Update any scaffolder modules**

Ensure they are built for the Backstage version used in RHDH 1.9. Otherwise the backend may fail to start (e.g. `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'id')`). See [RHDHBUGS-2497](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHDHBUGS-2497) as a known issue.
