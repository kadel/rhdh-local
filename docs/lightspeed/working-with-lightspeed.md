# Working with Developer Lightspeed

Red Hat Developer Lightspeed (Developer Lightspeed) is a virtual assistant powered by generative AI that offers in-depth insights into Red Hat Developer Hub (RHDH), including its wide range of capabilities. You can interact with this assistant to explore and learn more about RHDH in greater detail.

Developer Lightspeed provides a natural language interface within the RHDH console, helping you easily find information about the product, understand its features, and get answers to your questions as they come up.

Developer Lightspeed is included in RHDH Local by default — no additional setup scripts or compose files are required. To disable it, see [Disabling Lightspeed](#disabling-lightspeed).

## Supported Architecture

Developer Lightspeed for Red Hat Developer Hub is available as a plug-in on all platforms that host RHDH, and it requires the use of Lightspeed Core.

Developer Lightspeed uses a **Bring Your Own Model (BYOM)** architecture. No inference provider is bundled by default — you must configure at least one external LLM provider. The application starts in an unconfigured state and the UI will reflect this until a provider is set up.

## Configure an Inference Provider

!!! important
  
    You **must** configure at least one inference provider in your `.env` file before the chatbot will be functional. Without a configured provider, Lightspeed will start in an unconfigured state.

Developer Lightspeed supports any service that is **OpenAI API compatible**. Configure **at least one** of the following providers in your `.env` file. You can enable multiple providers simultaneously.

If you don't already have a `.env` file, create one from the template:

```bash
cp default.env .env
```

!!! note

    **Supported Providers:**
    Developer Lightspeed supports any service that is **OpenAI API compatible**, including but not limited to:
    - **vLLM**: A high-performance inference server (self-hosted or cloud)
    - **OpenAI**: OpenAI's API (GPT-4, etc.)
    - **Ollama**: A locally or remotely hosted Ollama instance
    - **Vertex AI**: Google Cloud's Vertex AI service (experimental)

!!! note

    If you intend to use any environment variables in the Lightspeed Core configuration file, `lightspeed-stack.yaml`, it is important to note that Lightspeed Core parses environment variables differently than what is typical. Environment variables for this file must be in the form:

    `${env.VAR}`

    `${env.VAR:=default-value}`

    `${env.VAR:+value}`

---

### Option A: vLLM Provider (or Any OpenAI API Compatible Endpoint)

Use vLLM for high-performance inference with self-hosted or cloud-based vLLM servers. **This provider configuration also works with any OpenAI API compatible service** (Azure OpenAI, LM Studio, Mistral, Nvidia NIM, etc.) that provides an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

```env
# Enable vLLM provider (or generic OpenAI API compatible endpoint)
ENABLE_VLLM=true

# REQUIRED: URL to your server (must end with /v1)
# Examples:
#   - vLLM server: https://your-vllm-server.com/v1
#   - Azure OpenAI: https://your-resource.openai.azure.com/v1
#   - LM Studio: http://localhost:1234/v1
#   - Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint
VLLM_URL=https://your-server.com/v1

# REQUIRED: API key for authentication (if your server requires it)
# For Azure OpenAI, use your Azure API key
# For LM Studio or local servers, you can use any value or leave as default
VLLM_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

# OPTIONAL: Maximum tokens per request (default: 4096)
# VLLM_MAX_TOKENS=4096

# OPTIONAL: TLS verification (default: true)
# Set to false for local servers with self-signed certificates
# VLLM_TLS_VERIFY=true
```

!!! tip

    **Using Other OpenAI API Compatible Services:**

    If you have an OpenAI API compatible endpoint that doesn't have its own provider configuration (like Azure OpenAI, LM Studio, Mistral, Nvidia NIM, etc.), you can use the **vLLM provider configuration** above. Simply:
    1. Set `ENABLE_VLLM=true`
    2. Set `VLLM_URL` to your service's endpoint (must end with `/v1`)
    3. Set `VLLM_API_KEY` to your service's API key (if required)

    The `remote::vllm` provider type accepts any OpenAI API compatible endpoint, not just vLLM servers.

### Option B: OpenAI Provider

Use OpenAI's API to access GPT models (GPT-4, etc.).

```env
# Enable OpenAI provider
ENABLE_OPENAI=true

# REQUIRED: Your OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

### Option C: Ollama Provider

Use an externally hosted Ollama instance to serve models. You must run your own Ollama server separately — it is not bundled in the compose setup.

```env
# Enable Ollama provider
ENABLE_OLLAMA=true

# REQUIRED: URL to your Ollama server (must end with /v1)
# Examples:
#   - Local Ollama: http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
#   - Remote Ollama: https://your-ollama-server.com:11434/v1
OLLAMA_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
```

!!! note
  
    Since Ollama runs outside the compose stack, you need to ensure the URL is accessible from within the containers. For a locally running Ollama, use `host.docker.internal` (Docker) or `host.containers.internal` (Podman) instead of `localhost`.

### Option D: Vertex AI Provider (Experimental)

Use Google Cloud's Vertex AI service to run Gemini models.

!!! warning
  
    **Experimental Feature:** Using Vertex AI to run Google models is experimental. Vertex AI provides an OpenAI-compatible API for Gemini models, which is why it can work with Developer Lightspeed (which supports OpenAI API implementations). This is provided as an alternative way to access Google models since `remote:gemini` is not yet fully supported.

```env
# Enable Vertex AI provider
ENABLE_VERTEX_AI=true

# REQUIRED: Absolute path to your Google Cloud credentials JSON file
VERTEX_AI_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your/google-cloud-credentials.json

# REQUIRED: Your GCP project ID
VERTEX_AI_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id

# OPTIONAL: GCP location/region (default: us-central1)
# VERTEX_AI_LOCATION=us-central1
```

!!! note
  
    **To use Vertex AI, you need:**
    1. A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with Vertex AI API enabled
    2. A service account with appropriate permissions
    3. A service account key file (JSON) downloaded from GCP
    4. Set `VERTEX_AI_PROJECT` to your project ID
    5. Set `VERTEX_AI_CREDENTIALS_PATH` to the absolute path of your credentials JSON file

---

## Query Validation Configuration (Optional)

Developer Lightspeed supports query validation, which restricts the chatbot to RHDH-related questions. When enabled, off-topic queries (e.g., asking about the weather) will be rejected while development-related questions are allowed.

```env
# Enable query validation
ENABLE_VALIDATION=true

# REQUIRED if validation is enabled: Must be one of your enabled providers
# Example: if ENABLE_OPENAI=true, then set VALIDATION_PROVIDER=openai
VALIDATION_PROVIDER=openai

# REQUIRED if validation is enabled: Must be an available model for the chosen provider
# Example: VALIDATION_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
VALIDATION_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
```

!!! note
  
    The validation provider must be one of your enabled inference providers, and the model must be available on that provider.

---

## Verify Services Are Running

After starting the application with `podman compose up -d` (or `docker compose up -d`), verify all services are running:

```bash
podman compose ps
# OR
docker compose ps
```

You should see output similar to:

| CONTAINER ID | IMAGE | CREATED | STATUS | NAMES |
|--------------|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| 31c3c681b742 | quay.io/rhdh-community/rhdh:next | 16 seconds ago | Exited (0) 5 seconds ago | rhdh-plugins-installer |
| f7b74b9f241e | quay.io/rhdh-community/rhdh:next | 4 seconds ago | Up 5 seconds (starting) | rhdh |
| a4e2b1f38d90 | quay.io/redhat-ai-dev/rag-content:release-1.10-... | 16 seconds ago | Exited (0) 10 seconds ago | rag-init |
| 2860fc13b036 | quay.io/lightspeed-core/lightspeed-stack:0.5.1 | 15 seconds ago | Up 5 seconds (starting) | lightspeed-core |

- `rhdh-plugins-installer` and `rag-init` are init containers — they run once and exit with status `0`.
- `rhdh` and `lightspeed-core` should show `Up` or `running`.

Open http://localhost:7007/lightspeed in your browser to access Developer Lightspeed.

## Plugin Configuration Reference

The Lightspeed plugin can be configured in `configs/app-config/app-config.yaml`:

```yaml
lightspeed:
  # OPTIONAL: Custom users prompts displayed to users
  # If not provided, the plugin uses built-in default prompts
  prompts:
    - title: <prompt_title>              # REQUIRED: Display title for the prompt
      message: <prompt_message>          # REQUIRED: The actual prompt text/question
  
  # OPTIONAL: Backend-only configurations
  servicePort: 8080                      # OPTIONAL: Port for lightspeed service (default: 8080)

```

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `prompts` | Array | No | Built-in prompts | Custom welcome prompts for users |
| `prompts[].title` | String | Yes* | - | Display title for the prompt (*required if prompts array is provided) |
| `prompts[].message` | String | Yes* | - | The actual prompt text/question (*required if prompts array is provided) |
| `servicePort` | Number | No | `8080` | Port for lightspeed backend service |
| `systemPrompt` | String | No | RHDH default | Custom system prompt to override default behavior |

### Example Configuration

## Disabling Lightspeed

If you don't configure an LLM provider, Lightspeed will remain in an unconfigured/dormant state and not affect your RHDH experience.

To fully disable Lightspeed:

1. **Stop the Lightspeed services** by copying the provided example override file:

   ```sh
   cp compose.lightspeed-disabled.override.example.yaml compose.override.yaml
   ```

   This prevents `rag-init` and `lightspeed-core` from starting. To re-enable, delete `compose.override.yaml`.

2. **Disable the Lightspeed plugins** in your `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml`. If you don't have one yet, copy the example file:

   ```sh
   cp configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.example.yaml \
      configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.override.yaml
   ```

   Then add (or uncomment) the following entries in the `plugins` section, setting `disabled: true` on both the Lightspeed frontend and backend plugins to remove all Lightspeed UI elements:

   ```yaml
   plugins:
     # Disable Lightspeed frontend plugin
     - package: 'oci://registry.access.redhat.com/rhdh/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-lightspeed:{{inherit}}'
       disabled: true

     # Disable Lightspeed backend plugin
     - package: 'oci://registry.access.redhat.com/rhdh/red-hat-developer-hub-backstage-plugin-lightspeed-backend:{{inherit}}'
       disabled: true
   ```

   !!! note
       Do **not** edit `configs/dynamic-plugins/dynamic-plugins.yaml` directly. The override file replaces the default configuration at runtime (see [How RHDH Local handles dynamic plugins configuration](../rhdh-local-guide/dynamic-plugins-management.md#how-rhdh-local-handles-dynamic-plugins-configuration)).

Step 1 alone stops the Lightspeed backend services but leaves the plugins installed (the UI may appear in a non-functional state). Step 2 removes the Lightspeed UI elements entirely. Both steps are reversible.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Services Not Starting or Exiting Unexpectedly

- **Check container logs:**  
  ```bash
  podman logs <container-name>
  # OR
  docker logs <container-name>
  ```

- **Common causes:**
  - Port conflicts (another service is using the same port)
  - Insufficient memory or CPU resources
  - Incorrect environment variables

### 2. "Permission Denied" or File Access Errors

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access files and directories, especially when mounting volumes.
- On Linux/macOS, you may need to adjust permissions with `chmod` or run commands with `sudo`.

### 3. Web UI Not Accessible at http://localhost:7007/lightspeed

- Make sure all containers are running:
  ```bash
  podman compose ps
  # OR
  docker compose ps
  ```
- Check for firewall or VPN issues that may block access to localhost ports.

### 4. Chatbot Shows Unconfigured State

- Developer Lightspeed starts unconfigured by default. You must configure at least one inference provider in your `.env` file.
- **Verify provider is enabled**: Check that at least one of `ENABLE_VLLM=true`, `ENABLE_OPENAI=true`, `ENABLE_OLLAMA=true`, or `ENABLE_VERTEX_AI=true` is set in your `.env` file.
- **Check required variables**: Ensure all required variables for your chosen provider are set.
- **Verify connectivity**: Ensure the provider URL is accessible from within the container.
- **Check logs**: Review `lightspeed-core` container logs for provider connection errors:
  ```bash
  podman logs lightspeed-core
  # OR
  docker logs lightspeed-core
  ```
- **Validate API keys**: Ensure API keys are correct and have proper permissions.

### 5. Environment Variables Not Set

- Double-check that your `.env` file is present and correctly configured.
- Restart the containers after making changes to environment files.

### 6. Query Validation Not Working

If you enabled query validation but it isn't filtering queries:

- **Verify validation is enabled**: Check that `ENABLE_VALIDATION=true` is set in your `.env` file.
- **Check provider**: Ensure `VALIDATION_PROVIDER` is set to one of your enabled inference providers.
- **Check model**: Ensure `VALIDATION_MODEL_NAME` is set to a model available on the validation provider.

### 7. Still Stuck?

- Try stopping and removing all containers, then starting again:
  ```bash
  podman compose down --volumes
  podman compose up -d
  ```
