## Contributing

We actively encourage contributions of all types! Here's how you can help:

### Types of Contributions

#### Bug Reports and Fixes

- **Identify and report bugs** with detailed reproduction steps
- **Submit patches** for bugs you can fix
- **Test fixes** from other contributors

#### Feature Development

- **Propose new features** through JIRA
- **Implement approved features** following project guidelines
- **Improve existing functionality** with backwards compatibility

#### Documentation Improvements

- **Update guides** for clarity and accuracy
- **Add missing documentation** for new features

### Branching Model

This repository uses a `main`/`dev` branching model to separate stable content from active development:

| Branch | Purpose | Tracks |
|---|---|---|
| **`main`** (default) | Latest stable GA release of RHDH | Current GA RHDH version |
| **`dev`** | Active development for the upcoming RHDH release | RHDH `next` tag |
| **`release-x.y`** | Release stabilization and patch releases | Specific RHDH version |

#### Which branch should my PR target?

| Change type | Target branch |
|---|---|
| All development work (features, docs, dependency updates, etc.) | `dev` |
| Bug fixes for a specific supported release | `release-x.y` |

Do not target `main` directly. Maintainers manage `main` via merges and cherry-picks.

At Feature Freeze, a `release-x.y` branch is created from `dev` for stabilization. At GA, the release branch is merged into `main`, so `main` always reflects the latest stable RHDH release. Maintainers cherry-pick changes to `main` when appropriate (e.g., version-independent fixes that should not wait until the next GA).

### Contribution Workflow

#### 1. Prepare Your Environment

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork locally
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/rhdh-local.git && cd rhdh-local

# Add upstream remote for staying current
git remote add upstream https://github.com/redhat-developer/rhdh-local.git
git fetch upstream

# Create a branch from dev (see "Which branch should my PR target?" above)
git checkout -b feature/my-contribution upstream/dev
```

#### 2. Development Guidelines

**Code Contributions:**

- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Include appropriate tests for new functionality
- Ensure changes don't break existing functionality, as much as possible

**Documentation Contributions:**

- Use clear, practical language written "engineer-to-engineer"
- Include code examples and practical snippets
- Test documentation by following your own instructions
- Maintain consistent formatting with existing docs

**Configuration Contributions:**

- Test configurations thoroughly before submitting
- Document any prerequisites or limitations
- Include examples for common use cases
- Remove sensitive information (tokens, passwords)

#### 3. Review Process

- **Automated checks** will run on your PR
- **Maintainers** will review your contribution
- **Address feedback** promptly and professionally
- **Iterate** based on review comments
- **Celebrate** when your contribution is merged!

## Contributing to Built-in TechDocs

The documentation you're reading now is built into RHDH Local and automatically rendered as TechDocs in the running application. Contributing to this documentation is especially valuable!

### Documentation Standards

#### Content Guidelines

- **Engineer-to-engineer perspective**: Write for technical users who prefer concise, practical information
- **Step-by-step instructions**: Break complex processes into clear, numbered steps
- **Code examples**: Include working examples that users can copy and modify
- **Cross-references**: Link to related documentation appropriately
- **Troubleshooting focus**: Anticipate common issues and provide solutions
- Update `mkdocs.yaml` if adding new pages or changing structure

#### Formatting Standards

See [Making Your TechDocs More Appealing](../getting-started-rhdh/making-techdocs-appealing.md) for practical tips on using TechDocs.

#### Testing Documentation

1. **Write the documentation** following the standards above
2. **Test the instructions** by following them yourself on a fresh setup
3. **Preview in RHDH Local** to verify formatting and links work
4. **Have someone else test** your instructions (when possible)

#### Applying local changes

At container startup, RHDH Local copies `mkdocs.yaml`, `docs/`, and `catalog-info.yaml` from a read-only bind mount into a writable in-container workdir. TechDocs generation updates `mkdocs.yaml` in that workdir, so the running instance does not watch your host files directly.

After editing built-in TechDocs on the host, restart the RHDH container to pick up your changes:

```bash
podman compose stop rhdh   # or: docker compose stop rhdh
podman compose start rhdh  # or: docker compose start rhdh
```

!!! note "Restart required for local preview"
    Previously, editing `docs/` on the host was reflected in the TechDocs UI after a page reload. With the writable workdir copy, a container restart is required to re-sync source files before you can preview updates in RHDH Local.

#### TechDocs Review Process

Note that TechDocs changes may need to be reviewed by a Product Manager and/or Architect to ensure content accuracy, clarity, and alignment with user needs.

#### Best Practices for TechDocs Contributions

- **Start small**: Begin with minor improvements to learn the workflow
- **Collaborate early**: Discuss major documentation changes via [JIRA issues](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20in%20(%22Red%20Hat%20Developer%20Hub%20Bugs%22%2C%20%22Red%20Hat%20Internal%20Developer%20Platform%22)%20%20AND%20component%20%3D%20%22RHDH%20Local%22%20AND%20resolution%20is%20EMPTY%20ORDER%20BY%20status%2C%20priority%2C%20updated%20%20%20%20DESC) before investing significant effort
- **Keep it practical and engineer-oriented**: Keep the built-in TechDocs oriented toward engineers with practical commands. The goal is not to repeat the official RHDH documentation
- **Update regularly**: Keep documentation current as features evolve
- **Ask for help**: Reach out to the team if you're unsure about content direction
