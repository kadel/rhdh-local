# This Compose file is not usable on its own.
# It needs to be used alongside the default compose.yaml file,
# since it overrides the containers defined in the latter
# and injects a new proxy container and adds a new network.
#
# You can run `[podman|docker]-compose -f compose.yaml -f compose-with-corporate-proxy.yaml config`
# to view the effective merged config.
